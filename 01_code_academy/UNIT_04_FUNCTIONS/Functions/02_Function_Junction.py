"""Function Junction

Functions are defined with three components:

    The header, which includes the def keyword, the name of the function, and any parameters the function requires. Here's an example:

    def hello_world(): // There are no parameters

    An optional comment that explains what the function does.

    " " "Prints 'Hello World!' to the console." " " 

    The body, which describes the procedures the function carries out. The body is indented, just like for conditional statements.

    print "Hello World!"

Here's the full function pieced together:

def hello_world():
    " " "Prints 'Hello World!' to the console." " "
    print "Hello World!"

# Define your spam function starting on line 5. You
# can leave the code on line 11 alone for now--we'll
# explain it soon!

def spam():
    """Prints 'Eggs!' to the console."""
    print "Eggs!"


# Define the spam function above this line.
spam()
