if is a conditional statement that executes some specified code after checking if its expression is True.

Here's an example of if statement syntax:

if 8 < 9:
    print "Eight is less than nine!"
In this example, 8 < 9 is the checked expression and print "Eight is less than nine!" is the specified code.

response = 'Y'

answer = "Left"
if answer == "Left":
	print "This is the Verbal Abuse Room, you heap of parrot droppings!"
    
# Will the above print statement print to the console?
# Set response to 'Y' if you think so, and 'N' if you think not.
